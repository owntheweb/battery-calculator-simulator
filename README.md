![layout preview for the battery requirements calculator](/docs/preview.png)

The battery requirements calculator will help determine how much power is needed for a project based on all of its components, then how many and what type of batteries are needed to keep the project running for the desired amount of time before recharge.

This is a work in progress. Feel free to follow along and have a very nice day. :D
